  <h3 id="career1">Before asking this question, I believe we should identify what exactly a programming language is.</h3>
  <p class="writing"> A programming language is a format and language that is tasked to give a set of instructions to a computer to execute. This is essentially the same as you cooking using a recipe; think of yourself as the computer, and the recipe as the code. There are many different programming languages that are all tasked to do different things, some are to make video games, some are to make the core components of websites, some are to stylize the website, some are for statistics, some are for data science and machine learning, and the list goes on!</p>
  <h3 id="career">Now, what are the most popular languages?</h3>
  <p class="writing"><b>Python:</b> Python is a very versatile general purpose programming language. It is used in many different fields, ranging from data science, to web development. It is a very common first programming language to learn. </p>
